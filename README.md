## Learning Vim
This file will be for important information I've found by using and configurating Vim.

- Caps Lock and Escape keys should be swapped for ease of use. You can do this by saving the following code using notepad.

'''
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,3a,00,01,00,01,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00

Save this as a .reg file and import it into the Regedit section of Windows.

- Scrolling speed increase can be found in the keyboard properties section of control panel
